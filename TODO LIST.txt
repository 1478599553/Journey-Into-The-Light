BEFORE RELEASE 1.12 List

Items:
Armour needs to be added back
Bows need to be fixed
All items need to be tested and checked that no crash occures

Blocks:
All blocks need to be placed down and used if an interaction is avaliable to check crashes
Fix tileentities (summoning and grindstone)
remove unused blocks
Make certain blocks use metadata types (Ryan can do this)
Fix corba portal frame so it creates the portal when the eyes are placed inside the slots

Rendering:
Item JSONS need to written in the way of the new ones (refer to vanilla basic items using the parent "item/handheld" to assure of proper perspective in first and third person)
column / grass type blocks need new Item jsons 
fix custom chest rendering (different chest types should be rendered with different textures)

Registrys:
Finish crafting recipes
Finish sounds

Structures:
Make mage and blacksmith buildings village pieces (maybe) or make them much less common
Fix nether trees so they properly generate over nethic soil
correctly register and add all loot tables

Dimensions:
Add mob spawning to dimensions (All dimensions are read as plains biomes, should be changed to the correct biomes)
Fix certain teleporters (corba and depths specifically)

Entitys:
Make sure all mobs are placed to prevent crashes on spawn
Fix bosses, flying mobs, ranged mobs and pets
get obsidian boat to move
make certain bosses actually challenging and unique (later)

Misc:
Fix essence bar so that the HUD updates (maybe change it to be more like the xp bar and have it overlap it when being used, frees up space and allows for more precise mana consumption)
Make sure everything is fairly balanced (weapons, tools, armor, mobs, etc.)

CODE:
Brock is to check through code and get rid of un useless classes and combine others such as food classes
