General important things:
ADD MOD SUPPORT!!!! (JEI, etc etc)

Items:
All items need to be tested and checked that no crash occurs
Remove unused items

Blocks:

Fix tileentities (summoning and grindstone)
remove unused blocks
Fix corba portal frame so it creates the portal when the eyes are placed inside the slots

Rendering:
Fix essence bar so that the HUD updates (maybe change it to be more like the xp bar and have it overlap it when being used, frees up space and allows for more precise mana consumption)

Registries:
Finish tweaking sounds

Structures:
finish loot tables

Fix certain teleporters (corba specifically)

All bosses suck. They're either too challenging, not challenging at all, or just repetitive and boring.

Run as server and make sure there's no crash

CODE:
Brock is to check through code and get rid of un useless classes and combine others such as food classes
