BEFORE RELEASE 1.12 List

General important things:
ADD MOD SUPPORT!!!! (JEI, Biomes O' Plenty (nether), etc etc)

Items:
Bows need to be fixed
Remove essence arrows because they're unnecessary
All items need to be tested and checked that no crash occures
Remove unused items

Blocks:
All blocks need to be placed down and used if an interaction is avaliable to check crashes
Fix tileentities (summoning and grindstone)
remove unused blocks
Fix corba portal frame so it creates the portal when the eyes are placed inside the slots

Rendering:
column / grass type blocks need new Item jsons 
fix custom chest rendering (different chest types should be rendered with different textures)
Fix essence bar so that the HUD updates (maybe change it to be more like the xp bar and have it overlap it when being used, frees up space and allows for more precise mana consumption)

Registrys:
Finish crafting recipes
Finish sounds

Structures:
correctly register and add all loot tables (almost done)

Dimensions:
Fix certain teleporters (corba specifically)

Entitys:
Make sure all mobs are placed to prevent crashes on spawn
Fix bosses, ranged mobs and pets
get obsidian boat to move
All bosses suck. They're either too challenging, not challenging at all, or just repetitive and boring.

Misc:
Make sure everything is fairly balanced (weapons, tools, armor, mobs, etc.)
Run as server and make sure there's no crash

CODE:
Brock is to check through code and get rid of un useless classes and combine others such as food classes


Future plans:
Overworld biomes, dimension biomes, more staves and wands, End update
